        <p class="speech">You won't get out of it like that. I only found out to-day
            that those tickets are in pawn. You must excuse me, _maman_, but
            it's only swindlers who behave like that. I'm not doing this out of
            egoisticism [Note: So in the original]--I don't want your tickets--but
            on principle; and I don't allow myself to be done by anybody. I have
            made your daughter happy, and if you don't give me the tickets to-day
            I'll make short work of her. I'm an honourable man!</p>

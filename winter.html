        <p>APLOMBOV. You won't get out of it like that. I only found out to-day
            that those tickets are in pawn. You must excuse me, _maman_, but
            it's only swindlers who behave like that. I'm not doing this out of
            egoisticism [Note: So in the original]--I don't want your tickets--but
            on principle; and I don't allow myself to be done by anybody. I have
            made your daughter happy, and if you don't give me the tickets to-day
            I'll make short work of her. I'm an honourable man!
            
            NASTASYA TIMOFEYEVNA. [Looks round the table and counts up the covers]
            One, two, three, four, five...
            
            A WAITER. The cook asks if you would like the ices served with rum,
            madeira, or by themselves?
            
            APLOMBOV. With rum. And tell the manager that there's not enough wine.
            Tell him to prepare some more Haut Sauterne. [To NASTASYA TIMOFEYEVNA]
            You also promised and agreed that a general was to be here to supper.
            And where is he?</p>

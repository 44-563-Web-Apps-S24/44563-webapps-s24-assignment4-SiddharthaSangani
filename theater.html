        <h1>Siddhartha Sangani does Chekov tonight</h1>
        <h2>THE WEDDING Anton Chekov</h2>
        <p>
            The scene is laid in one of the rooms of Andronov's Restaurant
        </p>

<p>[A brilliantly illuminated room. A large table, laid for supper. Waiters
    in dress-jackets are fussing round the table. An orchestra behind the
    scene is playing the music of the last figure of a quadrille.]</p>

<p>[ANNA MARTINOVNA ZMEYUKINA, YATS, and a GROOMSMAN cross the stage.]
</p>

<h5>ZMEYUKINA.</h5> <p class="speech">No, no, no!</p>

<h5>YATS.</h5> <p class="direction">[Following her] </p><p class="speech">Have pity on us! Have pity!</p>

<h5 >ZMEYUKINA.</h5> <p>No, no, no!</p>
<h5 >GROOMSMAN.</h5> <p >[Chasing them]</p> 
<p >You can't go on like this! Where are you off
    to? What about the _grand ronde? Grand ronde, s'il vous plait_!</p> 
    <p >[They all go off.]</p>
<p >[Enter NASTASYA TIMOFEYEVNA and APLOMBOV.]</p>
<h5 >NASTASYA TIMOFEYEVNA.</h5> 
<p >You had much better be dancing than upsetting me with your speeches.</p>

<h5>APLOMBOV.</h5> 
<p>I'm not a Spinosa or anybody of that sort, to go making
    figures-of-eight with my legs. I am a serious man, and I have a
    character, and I see no amusement in empty pleasures. But it isn't just
    a matter of dances. You must excuse me, maman, but there is a good deal
    in your behaviour which I am unable to understand. For instance, in
    addition to objects of domestic importance, you promised also to give
    me, with your daughter, two lottery tickets. Where are they?</p>
<h5 >NASTASYA TIMOFEYEVNA.</h5>
<p > My head's aching a little... I expect it's on
    account of the weather.... If only it thawed!
